# BluetoothChatDemo
Bluetooth Chat Demo demonstrates Bluetooth functionality in the form of a basic chat application.

The app should be run on two separate devices. When started, it will display
two lists: one for discovered devices and one for paired devices. Clicking on
an entry in either list will cause the app to attempt to connect to that
remote device. If the remote device is running this app, the connection will
succeed and both devices will then display the chat UI and text can be sent
and received. Clicking on "Done" on either device will terminate the session
and both devices will return to the original screen.
