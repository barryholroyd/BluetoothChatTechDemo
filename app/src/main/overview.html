    <h1>Description</h1>
    Bluetooth chat application.

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    This app demonstrates Bluetooth functionality in the form of a basic
    chat application. The app should be run on two separate devices. When
    started, it will display two lists: one for discovered devices and
    one for paired devices. Clicking on an entry in either list will cause
    the app to attemp to connect to that remote device. If the remote
    device is running this app, the connection will succeed and both devices
    will then display the chat UI and text can be sent and received. Clicking
    on "Done" on either device will terminate the session and both devices
    will return to the original screen.

    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    This implementation follows the Bluetooth Classic (3.0) API.
    <p>
    Two Activities are defined: MainActivity and ChatActivity.
    <ul>
      <li>MainActivity is the initial Activity. It is used to create a
          connection.
      <li>ChatActivity displays the chat UI and is used to run the chat
          session.
    </ul>
    MainActivity displays the "client" UI, i.e., two lists of devices
    (discovered and paired) used to initiate a connection as a "client".
    It then creates a background thread to become the "server" which
    listens for incoming connection requests.
    <ul>
      <li>BluetoothClient is used to initiate a connection as a client.
      <li>BluetoothServer is used to accept a connection as a server.
    </ul>
    <p>
    In both cases, when a connection is made, ChatActivity is fired up
    to run the actual chat session, sending and receiving text messages.
